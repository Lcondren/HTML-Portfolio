<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Luke Condren, I have worked in Financial Services for many years.
  I have recently completed a Higher Diploma in Software Development in ATU Galway with a 2.1 result.
  I aspire to be good at Web Development in my spare time and get an understanding of the different frameworks that
  are involved in Web Development such as Django, Flask, Ionic, Angular to name a few.</p>

<p>When I am not working or doing any coding I enjoy taking some time out for myself and spend time with those around me.
  I am big into looking after my health and I workout about 3 times a week, it is great getting out and about and seeing some of the countryside.
  My friends are so lucky to have me in their lives, I think they would be extremely lost without me, I know they won't say it to my face but
  I know and that is all that mattters.
  Also I have a terrific person in my life named Bridin who I get to call my wife from 1st February 2025 onwards. </p>
